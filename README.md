# OHMSImport
Upload a valid .zip file containing valid OHMS XML files into Omeka.

# Possible Issue

Be sure to set background.php.path correctly in the Omeka application config.  This path will vary depending on your server setup.

Look in: /public_html/<omeka_install>/application/config/config.ini

Example line: background.php.path = "/usr/local/bin/php"
